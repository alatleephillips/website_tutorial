You can use paid services like Squarespace or Wix (which are beautiful, fast, and mobile-friendly, but expensive) or free services like R Blogdown or Quarto (which are easy and familiar, but lack design customization and aesthetics). Here, I cover an intermediate option that borrows the best of these approaches: creating a beautiful, tweak-able professional website for a low cost. ü•≥\n",

That being said, it does help to know some very basic commands for navigating [HTML](https://www.math.uh.edu/~torok/math_6298/html/commands.html), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/), and [Bash](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/bash-commands-to-manage-directories-files/).

My personal website took me about two weeks to make over many few hour sessions, but it was fairly complicated and had many components. The simpler your website is, the faster it will be to build!

Next, open these as separate tabs in the text editor and scaffold them in the same way as above. It helped me to create sub-folders in my images for each of these pages - just be sure to note the paths called for in the html code if you do that.
